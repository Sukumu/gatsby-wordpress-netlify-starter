Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[Peach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach).

> The Peach is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of 
>the Kunlun >Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated. 
>The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the corrugated seed shell. >Due to their close relatedness, the inside of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make >a cheap version of marzipan, known as persipan.
>Peaches and nectarines are the same species, even though they are regarded commercially as different fruits. 
>China produced 58% of the world's total peaches and nectarines in 2016.
